This repository contains a complete E-Commerce Data Analysis project in Python. It includes synthetic dataset generation, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and RFM customer segmentation. The project features visualizations for monthly sales trends, top products and categories, payment methods, and country-wise sales, along with a correlation matrix of numeric features. Cleaned datasets are saved for further modeling or analysis.

Key Highlights:

Generates a realistic synthetic e-commerce dataset if none is provided.

Handles missing values, duplicates, and datatype conversions robustly.

Extracts features such as order year, month, day, and day-of-week.

Provides customer-level aggregates (total orders, total spent, average order value).

Visualizes sales trends, top products/categories, RFM analysis, payment methods, and country-wise sales.

Designed as a standalone Python script, fully executable without Jupyter Notebook.

Tech Stack:

Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
